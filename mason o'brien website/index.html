        <h1>The Maine Coon - America's Longhair Cat</h1>
        <p>One of the oldest natural breeds in North America, the Maine Coon is generally regarded as a native of the state of Maine (in fact, the Maine Coon is the official Maine State Cat). 

            First recorded in cat literature in 1861 with a mention of a black and white cat named "Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines," Maine Coons were popular competitors at early cat shows in Boston and New York. A brown tabby female named "Cosie" won Best Cat at the 1895 Madison Square Garden Show.  Unfortunately, their popularity as show cats declined with the arrival in 1900 of the more exotic Persians. Although the Maine Coon remained a favorite cat in New England, the breed did not begin to regain its former widespread popularity until the 1950's when more and more cat fanciers began to take notice of them, show them, and record their pedigrees. 
            </p>
        <h1>MCBFA</h1>
        <p>In 1968, six breeders formed the Maine Coon Breeders and Fanciers Association to preserve and promote the breed. Today, membership numbers over 1200 fanciers and 200 breeders. By 1980, all registries had recognized the Maine Coon, and it was well on its way to regaining its former glory.   Maine Coons were well established more than a century ago as a hardy, handsome breed of domestic cat, well equipped to survive the hostile New England winters. </p>
        <h1>One Big Cat</h1>
        <p>Everything about the Maine Coon points to its adaptation to a harsh climate. Its glossy coat, heavy and water-resistant, is like that of no other breed, and must be felt to be truly appreciated. The coat is longer on the ruff, stomach, and britches to protect against wet and snow, and shorter on the back and neck to guard against tangling in underbrush. Big, round, tufted feet help them negotiate uneven terrain and serve as "snow shoes." They are tall, muscular, and big-boned; males commonly reach 13 to 18 pounds, and females normally weigh about 9 to 12 pounds. Add to that two or three inches of winter coat, and people will swear that they're looking at one big cat. </p>
        <h1>Gentle Giants</h1>
        <P>Maine Coons develop slowly, and don't achieve their full size until they are three or four years old. Their dispositions remain kittenish throughout their lives; they are big, gentle, and good-natured. Maine Coons love to play, and many will joyfully retrieve small items.  Many people consider Maine Coons the perfect domestic pets, with their clown-like personalities, very affectionate natures, amusing habits and tricks, willingness to "help" with any activity, and easily groomed coats. They make excellent companions for large, active families that also enjoy having dogs and other animals around. 

            Welcome a Maine Coon into your home, and you will join the thousands who sing the praises of this handsome and lovable cat!
